## Features

### Data Mining (DM):
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling for optimal model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized key metrics, customer demographics, and service usage patterns.
- **Standardization**: Ensured consistent data scaling.
- **Additional Features**: Generated new attributes for better predictions.
- **Feature Selection**: Identified the most relevant features for churn prediction.
- **Clustering**: Grouped similar customers for deeper insights.

### Machine Learning (ML):
- **Data Balancing Techniques**:
  - SMOTE with ENN, under-sampling, and over-sampling strategies.
- **Classifiers Evaluated**:
  - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Network (MLP), LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, ROC curves, and confusion matrix.
- **Advanced Techniques**:
  - Feature selection,Feature Engineering, Voting Classifier, overfitting checks, and GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Deployment**: Integrated the final model into a user-friendly interface for predictions.

## Tools & Technologies
